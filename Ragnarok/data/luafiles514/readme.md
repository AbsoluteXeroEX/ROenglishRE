* Skill Rebalances

I will try my best to update the skillinfoz regarding the Skill Rebalances asap.
But I will go in this order:

	1. 1st/2nd and Transcended Classes [Divine-Pride.net](https://www.divine-pride.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3453-kro-mass-skills-balance-1st-2nd-and-transcendent-classes-skills/)
	   > Done
	2. Ninja Update [Hercules Board](https://herc.ws/board/topic/17057-kro-patch-2019-03-06/)
	3. 2nd Expanded Classes + 3rd Classes Part 1 [Divine-Pride.net](https://www.divine-pride.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3674-kro-update-schedule-in-the-first-quarter-of-2019/)
	4. 3rd Classes Part 2 [Divine-Pride.net](https://www.divine-pride.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3723-kro-classes-improvement-project/)
	5. Quest Skills [Hercules Board](https://herc.ws/board/topic/17545-kro-patch-2019-10-16/)

* Skill Lua Files
	- lua files
	> Contains the regular lua files and skillinfoz folder before the Skill Rebalances

	- lua files v1
	> Contains only the skillinfoz folder containing the #1 Skill Rebalance
	
	etc.

# Client Version
I'll mainly use the 2018-06-20 RagexeRE, while I will try to keep Zackdreaver's format
of two different skilltreeview files, but only test with one:
	> skilltreeview.lub = Before 2018-06-20 Clients
	> skilltreeview 20180621.lub = For 2018-06-20 Clients and later

Best regards,
